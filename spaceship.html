      <h2>Assignment Step 1: Multi-Key Compass Detector</h2>

      <p>Write an HTML/JavaScript program that displays the compass direction the user is currently pressing. It must update live as keys are held down (no Enter key needed).</p>

      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Detect key presses and releases in real time using JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Track multiple keys held at once.</li>
        <li>If the user is holding numeric keypad keys, interpret them as a 16-point compass. For example:</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="compass-map">
8 = N, 89 = NNE, 9 = NE, 69 = ENE, 6 = E, 36 = ESE, 3 = SE, 23 = SSE, 2 = S, 12 = SSW, 1 = SW, 14 = WSW, 4 = W, 47 = WNW, 7 = NW, 78 = NNW.
Numeric keys take priority over arrow keys.
      </div>

      <p>If no numeric keys are pressed, use the arrow keys as an 8-point compass (Up=N, Up+Right=NE, Right=E, Right+Down=SE, Down=S, Down+Left=SW, Left=W, Left+Up=NW).</p>

      <p>Display the resulting compass direction (or “None” if nothing is pressed).</p>
    </section>

    <section class="step">
      <h2>Assignment Step 2: Spaceship display.</h2>

      <p>In a previous class, we created rotations of a spaceship. Unfortunately, those rotations were not exactly the ones we need here, because when you think of a 16-point compass, the orientations between positions of the spaceship are 22.5 degrees between. So, re-run the earlier work for orientation of their spaceship to generate 16 images. Remember, these images have a transparent background, and they have to be a top view of the spaceship, because if there's perspective on the spaceship, then it will look weird when it rotates. So, as a pre-step for Part 2, create these 16 images of your spaceship. Also, to be consistent for all student's games, I will say that the spaceship's size should fill a 90 pixels by 90 pixels square, and must be centered in that square, and must be a bmp file with transparency.</p>

      <p>Another rule: The spaceship's color scheme should work on a black background (because space is black, and we are going to put your spaceship in a space scene).</p>

      <p>Once you have done this, you will then convert the previous HTML program that displayed a compass direction to instead display the spaceship in the given orientation. When no key is pressed, then the spaceship remains in its current orientation, and when a new direction is pressed, the spaceship will rotate into that new direction, either rotating clockwise or counterclockwise (whichever is closer) and that speed of rotation will be such as would achieve one full rotation per second (which is not to say that it's going to rotate a full rotation -- in fact, it will never rotate more than 180 degrees, but the speed of that rotation is one rotation per second).</p>
    </section>

    <section class="step">
      <h2>Assignment Step 3: Spaceship movement and shooting.</h2>

      <p>The screen now has a randomly generated starfield background.</p>

      <p>Your spaceship now moves around the screen, in the direction of its orientation (so, when it is rotating, it is also moving in its current oriented direction. The speed is 100 pixels per second. When it hits the edge of the window, it stops moving.</p>

      <div class="card">
If you press Shift, a torpedo is launched at a speed of 300 pixels per second.

If you press Space a lazer beam appears, as straight line drawn projected out from the front of the spaceship, which moves with the spaceship and dissappears when you release the space bar.
